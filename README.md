Enter your favourite dishes or choose from a list and get your weekly meal plan.

Made as a part of an assignment for the course Web and Mobile App development during the second year at Changemaker Educations Web and App development program in 2023.

## What I used

-   ESlint
-   Prettier
-   React
-   Tailwind CSS
-   TypeScript
-   UseState Hook
-   UseEffect Hook
-   Vite

## What I Learned

I had some experience using both Tailwind and TypeScript, but working on a larger project with them made me appreciate them a lot more. TypeScript became something that actually helped me instead of being a cumbersome extra step, and Tailwind is just so fast and effective as you learn more of the classes. This was a fun one!
